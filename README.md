# ProgrammingMicroController



I programmed a microcontroller type PIC18 to make it wrok as clock and display the temperature.

The microcontroller was PIC18F4580.


I used MikroC program to write the code 
also used RTC with Temperature, RTC to save the current time.

by using Proteus I did a simulation to test my code to save money and time.


Important: 
you should read the comments carefully, 
also be a ware if you didn't write data to RTC you will get empty data when you try to display it on LCD.
